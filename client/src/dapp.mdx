# Blockchain

> Dapp or Decentalized application are those application that uses smart contract, which are deployed on a blockchain netwrok for its functioning.

Dapp(Decentralized application) is the same application as a web application with the only extension of smart contracts. You can divide the Dapp into the following parts:

# Frontend

This is as it is in web development. You need to have your front end developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use any framework such as React, NextJS, or anything else.

# Backend

You can use the backend to interact with the smart contract deployed on the network. You can implement this in your frontend too, but separating the frontend and backend will help you manage the app easily.

# Smart Contract

Smart Contract will be deployed on the blockchain network. Our application will interact with it for the functioning of the application.

NFT Marketplace is an example of dApp. That‚Äôs pretty much the basic format required for the development of a dApp.
