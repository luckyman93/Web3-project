# What are Web2 and Web3?

Let’s just understand the meaning of these two terms **Web2** and **Web3.**

## Web2

Web2 is the second revolution of the internet. It refers to the period in which the number of the content creator on the web has increased. Previously, Web1 was mostly end-user-oriented. It was for consuming the information.

Web2 started with the rise of social media which let the end-user create content on the internet. This leads to the popularity of the content creator on the internet and eventually becoming a celebrity. During this period the content creator and consumer both grow together.

Web2 is also known for the centralization of the data. Big companies mostly control the data of the entire world. One company owns multiple companies to acquire different data from multiple sources. This become one of the problems for the web2 and led to the new revolution of the internet.

## Web3

Web3 is considered the next revolution of the internet. Web3 is the decentralization of data through blockchain-based applications and the use of the token for economics. The term "Web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. It is only gaining popularity recently due to so many resources and platforms available to develop the blockchain-based application.

Developers has mixed feeling about web3. Some considered it a trend that won’t last long. The experts in the field do consider the next big thing in webspace. I do believe in Web3 due to following reasons:

- Community is building in recent times for learning and developing
- There are startup ideas revolving around web3
- Companies are building tools that help the development process
- There are [grants](https://twitter.com/VittoStack/status/1491007572769488901) available for web3 projects

I highly recommend web developers to try out the web3 at least for once. Both Web2 and Web3 will co-exist with each other in the future. Let’s move forward to understand web3 better.
